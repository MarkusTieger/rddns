###########################################

# This file contains an exemplary configuration for rddns. Rddns configuration files are TOML files.

##
## ip_address
##

# Each ip_address configuration entry describes the source for a dynamic IP address. Each entry is a table of the form
# "[ip_address.<identifier>]" where <identifier> must be replaced with a unique key that is later used to reference this
# entry.
# There are different types of sources for ip_address entries. The type is configured with the "type" option.

# IP address sources of type "parameter" take the current IP address from a HTTP query parameter that is passed to the
# rddns HTTP server. The current IP address must be passed via a query parameter of the form "ip[<parameter>]" where
# <parameter> is the name of the  parameter that is configured with the "parameter" option.
#
# The following example configures an IP address source identified by "some_address" that takes IP addresses from the
# HTTP query parameter "ip[my_parameter]". An appropriate HTTP request to the rddns server would be
# http://rddns-server:3092?ip[my_parameter]=203.0.113.19
[ip_address.some_address]
type = "parameter"
parameter = "my_parameter"

# IP address sources of type "static" use a fixed IP address that is configured with the option "address".
[ip_address.otherAddress]
type = "static"
address = "2001:DB8:123:abcd::1"

# IP address sources of type "derived" combine the host part and the net part of two other ip_address entries to create
# a new IP address. The "subnet_entry" and the "host_entry" configuration options define which other IP adresses should
# be used for the host and for the net part.
#
# This is usefull to update global IPv6 addresses where the host part is fixed as it is derived from the MAC address but
# the provider assigns a different IPv6 subnet on every reconect. The router could then pass its own IPv6 address to the
# HTTP server of rddns. With this entry the net part of the routers IPv6 address can than be combined with the host part
# of a device behind the router.
#
# E.g. given "some_address" would be resolved to fd84:d40e:6a1b:f004:4bcf:78ff:feac:8bd9 then this entry would resolve
# to 2001:DB8:123:abcd:4bcf:78ff:feac:8bd9.
[ip_address.calculated_address]
type = "derived"
subnet_bits = 64
subnet_entry = "otherAddress"
host_entry = "some_address"

##
## ddns_entry
##

# Each [[ddns_entry]] section configures a Dynamic DNS entry that should be updated. Updates are HTTP requests to an URL
# that is configured with the "url" option. The URL can contain placeholder in the form of "{<identifier>}" where
# <identifier> must be the identifier of one of the IP addresses sources configured in an "[ip_address]" section. These
# placeholders will be replaced with the current IP addresse of the source on update.
# If update reqiuieres authentication credentials can be configured with the "username" and "password" options.

# The following entry is an example how to update an entry at the Hurrican Electric dynamic DNS service.
[[ddns_entry]]
url = "https://dyn.dns.he.net/nic/update?hostname=update.example.com?&myip={some_address}"
username = "update.example.com"
password = "secret"

# The following example demonstrates an update at a service that does not require credentials. The URL that is called
# would be resolved to "http://example.com/dynupdate/2001:DB8:123:abcd::1?doUpdate=true" as "otherAddress" is configured
# above to be a static IP address.
[[ddns_entry]]
url = "http://example.com/dynupdate/{otherAddress}?doUpdate=true"

## server
##

# This section configures the embedded HTTP server. It is optional. When it is missing default values will be used as
# described bellow.
[server]
# Configures username/password credentials that must be passed in HTTP requests to authorize update requests. BASIC auth
# must be used. When invalid credentials are supplied no DDNS updates are triggered.
# When no credentials are configured anybody can trigger DDNS updates via HTTP without authorization.
username = "admin"
password = "S3cr3T"
# The TCP port the server should listen on.
# Defaults to 3092 if missing.
port = 3042
